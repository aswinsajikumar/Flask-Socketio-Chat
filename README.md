# Flask-Socketio-Chat
A basic real-time chat application built with Flask and Socket.IO. This project demonstrates the use of WebSockets for live messaging between users in a web environment. The application allows multiple users to join a chat room, send and receive messages in real-time, and distinguishes between messages sent by the user and those sent by others.
